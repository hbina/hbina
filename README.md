List of projects that I worked on in no specific order.


# Projects

## ISO 14977 parser

A `Rust` library to parse EBNF that is (hopefully) fully ISO 14977 compliant.

Link to the repository: [iso_14977](https://github.com/hbina/iso_14977)

## Redis Protocol Parser

A no depedency and fast REdiS Protocol (RESP) parser. The protocol is simple, why make it hard?

Link: [redis-protocol-parser](https://github.com/hbina/redis-protocol-parser)

## riffu

A `Rust` library for dealing with `RIFF` file format.
This fork is a complete overhaul of the original library.
This fork is designed to have a cleaner interface, complete error propagations and gives users the option to either lazily or eagerly read into the file.

## otto_vec

A Rust library that provides a procedural macro that can automatically vectorize any pure functions.

Link to the repository: [otto_vec](https://github.com/hbina/otto_vec)

## smolset

Space efficient set implementation that defaults to stack allocated buffer when the number of elements is small and transform into heap allocated set when required. This is a fork of the original library with better fallback perforamnce (because of the mode) and more features (including their tests and documentations).

## fatuous

Basic 3D rendering engine in `C++` and `OpenGL`. Able to cast shadows, normal mapping and all that trivial stuff. I have some experience with `Vulkan` as well.

## Misc. Projects

I have also regularly read/contribute to `cargo`, `godot` and various other random projects that I find interesting. I like to read the source code of small projects a lot.

I am top ~100 contributor to `godot` and ~1000 downloads of my libraries in `crates.io`.
