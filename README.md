I mostly program in C/C++/Rust but I have also used JS/React Native/Python etc. etc.


# Projects

## riff

A `Rust` library for parsing the RIFF file format. This fork is a complete overhaul of the original repository with cleaner interface and better performance (imo) because it reads the entire content into memory for parsing instead of walking through the file. Only exposes opaque types so no copying is performed and safety is guaranteed by `Rust`!

## chisai

A program similar to `xxd` but can generate output for multiple types of programming languages. Is also multithreaded and about ~3x times faster than `xxd`.

## hyoka

Generic REPL as a `Rust` library. One can use this library to implement pretty much any REPL one can think of. If you browse the examples folder, I have implemented a simple calculator and `Lisp`-like interpreter using it.

## pixieve-rs

An unofficial fork of (an abandoned) an unofficial library to interface with the `pixiv` image hosting website. I am planning on using this to create a GUI for `pixiv`. It is quite hard to reverse engineer the various `Python` libraries for its API because `pixiv` does not officially document them.

## fatuous

Basic 3D rendering engine in `C++` and `OpenGL`. Able to cast shadows, normal mapping and all that trivial stuff. I have some experience with `Vulkan` as well.

## aoihana

A bunch of macros to create generic containers in `C`. This is mostly just experimental stuff. `C` makes it very hard to do proper type-safe containers.

## leetcode_cpp

My solutions to about ~100 `leetcode` problems.

## akarithm

A bunch of template algorithms in C++ that I use to solve `leetcode` problems and that I should be in the standard library.

## Misc. Projects

I have also regularly read/contribute to `cargo`, `godot` and various other random projects that I find interesting. I like to read the source code of small projects a lot.

I am top ~100 contributor to `godot` and ~1000 downloads of my libraries in `crates.io`.
